App Reflection
================


**App Capability**

- The app uses three different tabs to help studying the change in the job market, while highlighting the differences for both genders; males and females.


- The first tab addresses the research question about how the count of different jobs changed over years using a heatmap. By hovering over the heatmap, the user can select desired area covering one or multiple years and jobs. Selecting that area will display a bar graph showing the count of men and women doing those jobs next to the heatmap.   

- If the user wants to see the total number of people employed in a job, the tooltip gives that information also regarding a particular job in any year.   

- The second tab shows how the trend of different jobs changed over years. The user can select any job from the dropdown menu to see the trend of the selected job.   

- The third tab beautifully highlights the conclusion showing that how the proportion of the two genders changed over years.


**Limitations/Future Improvements**   

- The app only shows and studies 10 jobs, in the future version of the app, we will add a functionality to allow the user to select the jobs that they want to study.  

- The app uses a dataset that was collected in 2000, to better understand the current job market, we will look for a newer dataset and use it in version 2.0.  

- In this version (version 1.0) of the app, we didn’t study the relationship between the different jobs; such as the increase in the total employments for a job that caused a decrease in another job.

- In the future versions of the dashboard, we will consider datasets from different countries, or continents and make comparisons between them. 


**Addressing the Feedback**

This is the feedback we recieved in week 2 and addressed in milestone 2.

- In a response to the feedback (GitHub issues) we received from the TAs about the position of our tabs, we made the three tabs at the top of the 3 images instead of to the left side.   

- We also made our commit messages more informative as what the TA suggested in the feedback. 

- We added a description for each tab at the top as what the TA mentioned in the lab so that the users will know how to interact with the plots. 

- We also changed the font size using a customized theme and we made the titles in the plot more informative. 

- We improved the graph and the text sizes to make sure we did not violate the “Data:ink ratio” principle as our peers pointed out in the lab.

**Wishlist Features**

- If we have more time, we would love to add a fancier/prettier background to our dashboard.

- In the future we might add more functionalities to our "Gender ratio" tab so that users can see the gender ratio trend of each job upon their selection of the job. 

- In the future we might use CSS to format our dashboard.

- We hope that in the future we would get a dataset that includes the data from the 1890s. 


**Changes Decided to Make on response to Ellen's issue**

[issue link](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group107_JobAnalyzer/issues/27)

- If we have more time we would love to add a fancier/prettier background to our dashboard.

- In the future we might add more functionalities to our "Gender ratio" tab so that users can see the gender ratio trend of each job. 

- In the future we might use CSS to format our dashboard.

- We hope that in the future we would get a dataset that includes the data in 1890s. 


**Changes Decided to Make**

- We changed the default tab to be the "Job Count" tab so that the users would know the first tab is selected to be the default tab. 

- We added a title and a description of the entire app at the top of our dashboard in order to make it clear what the data represents.

- We added gender percentage to the tooltip on the Gender Gap chart to make it more informative. 

- We edited the spacing and typos of our tab descriptions.

- We explained in each tab how those jobs were selected and pointed out that the gender ratio plot includes all data sets. We also mentioned where the data comes from with a description of the dataset. 

- We fixed the small issue in our first tab where it shows sex twice. 

- We also fixed the sizes of the tabs so that they are consistent and just the right sizes without unnecessary spaces. 


**Changes made to address feedback received during lab session**

[issue 1](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group107_JobAnalyzer/issues/26)

[issue 2](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group107_JobAnalyzer/issues/25)

[issue 3](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/DSCI532_Group107_JobAnalyzer/issues/24)

Most of the feedback triggered the same suggestions. Which are summarized as following: 

**Feedback Received during Lab Session**


- Add a title and description of the whole app.

- Describe how the jobs were selected for each chart.

- Describe which region the data comes from.

- Change spacing and typos.

- Add percentage to the tooltip of the Gender Gap plot.

- Need to mention that the data in the heatmap is for 1 year, not for a decade. 

- Add a title to the drop-down in tab 2.

- Check the size of the pages, make them shorter.


**Reflection on the Feedback**

- Overall, our app is user-friendly. It was relatively easy for our peers to navigate through the app by following the descriptions at the top of each tab. They could interact with the plots and to see the trend in the way we wanted. 

- Most reviewers suggested that we should add a title and a description at the top of the app to inform the users what the data represents as well as how the jobs were selected for each chart. Some reviewers also mentioned the typos and minor errors with the tooltips.  

- Our first priority is to add a title and a description of the entire app such that the users are clear to what the data represents. This is part of our overall strategy for maintenance as it will explicitly express the purpose of our dashboard. 

- Our second priority is to explain in each tab how those jobs were selected and point out that the gender ratio chart includes all data sets. This is also part of our overall strategy to increase the clarity of our graphs. 

- Our third priority is to fix the small bugs with our tooltips. This can also make our reviewers less confounded. 

- Our fourth priority is to do a spacing and spelling check to make our dashboard flawless.

- We did not add a title for the drop-down since we think it is obvious that those choices are referring to jobs. 

- Our overall strategy for maintenance was to make our dashboard as clear and informative as possible. We do not want the users to be confused or ambiguous when exploring our app and interacting with our charts. 

- In short, the feedback process was very useful as it led to an informative, user-friendly, and error-free app.
